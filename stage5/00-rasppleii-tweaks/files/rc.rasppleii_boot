# De-NOOBS Raspberry Pi's config.txt
#
# NOOBS has a bad habit of hard-coding your video settings to try and ensure
# compatibility with broken HDMI displays.  If you are using composite, you
# need to hold keys at install time to tell NOOBS.  But we silentinstall
# Raspple II so you don't need any monitor at all.  Best option?  Remove the
# lines added by NOOBS.
